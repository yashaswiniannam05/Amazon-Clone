# Amazon-Clone
A simple frontend clone of the Amazon homepage built using HTML and CSS. This was my first project to practice basic web development skills like layout design, use of HTML elements, and CSS styling. Please note that this version is not responsive and is best viewed on desktop screens.

**This project was a valuable learning experience that helped me enhance my skills in:**<br>
 âœ… HTML for structuring content<br>
 âœ… CSS for responsive design and styling<br>
 âœ… UI/UX design principles to replicate a user-friendly interface<br>
 âœ… Attention to detail to match design elements closely with the original website<br><br>
 
# Why This Project?
I took on this challenge to:<br>
 ðŸŽ¯ Strengthen my front-end development skills
 ðŸŽ¯ Improve my understanding of how e-commerce websites are designed
 ðŸŽ¯ Build a portfolio project that showcases my ability to recreate complex interfaces
